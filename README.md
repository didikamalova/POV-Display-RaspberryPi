## Project title
Persistence of Vision (POV) Display

## Team members
Didi Kamalova, Naomi Mo, Aanya Tashfeen

## Project description
We created a spherical persistence of vision (POV) LED Display that works by spinning a circular array of LEDs and relies on our eyes' natural “refresh rates” to create the illusion of a solid image on a sphere. Equipped with an LED strip, a hall sensor, 3 battery packs and framed with a desk fan, it creates patterns upon reacting to magnets spaced out across the circular base of the fan.

## Member contribution
Aanya: graphics code, 3D modeling
Didi: led driver code, soldering & cable management
Naomi: hall sensor code, mechanical assembly

## Self-evaluation
We created a fully functioning prototype of an LED Display that allows for free spinning, coded up an LED Strip driver and successfully integrated hall sensor interrupts within our software.
