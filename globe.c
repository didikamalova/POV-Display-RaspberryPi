/* Filename: globe.c
 * This file contains the graphics code for a POV globe. It iterates through a HORIZONTAL_RESOLUTION by
 * VERTICAL_RESOLUTION image array stored in separate header files as they are quite long. The current implementation
 * works with a soccer ball and iterates through each column at an arbitrary 20 microsecond speed, independent of the 
 * hall sensor readings. The intended implementation is commented out below and uses the RTT_measure round trip time
 * measurement code to find the column number that the strip should be displaying and driving the LEDs in that way. The
 * RTT code works in a 10 second delay to allow the motor to reach an adequate speed before beginning to measure the 
 * average round trip time.
 *
 * Citation: Andreas Rottach, github username: rottaca
 * https://github.com/rottaca/PovGlobe/blob/master/pico_src/Renderer/LEDController.cpp
 * The implementation of the POV globe was loosely based on this implementation to get an idea for how to approach the problem.
 * However, the code was written from scratch and based on our understanding of the code as the cited code was not commented, 
 * implemented in a much more complicated way, and was difficult to interpret. The image arrays we used were also different from
 * his, so we had to tailor the code to work with our RTT and hall sensor implementation and the image array.
