## Project description
Short description of the basic idea and end goal you are aiming for. 
Include stretch goals and/or fallback position to indicate how you 
might fine-tune the project scope if needed.

Our group is aiming to create a spherical persistence of vision (POV)
device. The ideal goal is to have a fully functional, spinning ring of 
LEDs that generates the illusion of a sphere when it spins fast enough.
We hope to encode the image of a globe on the LEDs, though this is a 
stretch goal due to its complexity. Some fallback goals are to generate
fun patterns/a disco ball image on the device. If the 3D devices gives
us trouble, we may also fall back on generating a 2D image interface. 

## Hardware, budget
Itemize what hardware, if any, you need and your plan for acquiring it.
Rough budget for the project. We will reimburse up to $20 per person.

Required hardware:
- hall effect sensors (given to us by Pat!)
- magnets, preferably neodymium (hopefully Pat has some available, if not
we can order some for around ~$20)
- LED strip (from Lab 64)
- battery pack (from Lab 64)
- 3D-printed ring/mount (hopefully printed for free at Lab 64)
- DC motor

## Tasks, member responsibilities
Each team member should be responsible for a clearly identifiable part of the project.

(TBD)

## Schedule, midpoint milestones
What are the one-week goals you plan to meet for next week?

By the end of the upcoming weekend, we want our entire mechanical assembly
in place. By the end of the following weekend, we want a working sphere 
with a functional LED display. 

## Resources needed, issues
Are there books/code/tools/materials that you need access to? 
What are the possible risks to overcome? What are you concerned about? 
How can we help you succeed?
