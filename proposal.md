## Title:
Persistence of Vision (POV) Display

## Team Members:
Naomi Mo
Didi Kamalova
Aanya Tashfeen

## Project Description:
We want to create a spherical persistence of vision (POV) LED Display. 

Our goal is to create a fully functinoning LED Display that works by spinning a circular array of LEDs and relies on our eyes' natural “refresh
rates” to create the illusion of a solid image on a sphere.

We want to be able to display fun patterns (disco ball, for example) on it. If that works, we want to try encoding an image of the globe on our display and/or adding peripherals to it.

## Hardware & Budget:
Required hardware:
- x1 A3134 Hall Effect Sensor - Pat
- x8 Neodymium Magnets - Pat
- x2 AdaFruit DotStar LED strip 144 LED/m 0.5m - lab64
- x1 3AA Battery Pack - lab64
- x10 M4, M5 bolts & nuts - lab64/room 36
- x5 3D Printed Parts - lab64
- x1 ~200x200x20mm Steel/Wood Base Plate - lab64/room 36 wood scraps
- x1 (^) 12V 2000-3000RPM DC Motor (4mm) - Stanford Robotics Lab
- x1 (^) 8mm aluminum/steel rod - Room 36
- x1 (^) DC Motor Adapter (4/5mm to 8mm) - Stanford Robotics Lab
- x1 (^) Ball Bearing - Stanford Robotics Lab
- x1 (^) Rotary Slip Ring - Stanford Robotics Lab
- x1 Power Supply (for testing purposes) - lab64

(^) - items we're still searching for and may need to purchase elsewhere.
Rough Budget: $50-60 for components we won't be able to find.

## Tasks & Member Responsibilities:
Each team member should be responsible for a clearly identifiable part of the project.

Our project will be divided into the following categories:
Software: graphics module (gl_draw() functions), hall sensor driver, led driver.
Electrical: circuit schematics, power management, soldering.
Mechanical: ring, frame, motor, cable management, assembly.

Division of tasks (not final):

Aanya:

Didi: led setup, circuits, hardware sourcing

Naomi: hall sensors setup, 

## Schedule & Midpoint Milestones:
By the end of the upcoming weekend, we want our entire mechanical assembly in place. By the end of the following weekend, we want a working sphere 
with a functional LED display. 

## Resources Needed & Issues:
Are there books/code/tools/materials that you need access to? 
What are the possible risks to overcome? What are you concerned about? 
How can we help you succeed?

Our possible concerns include mechanical/electrical assembly problems that we may run into, such as rotating wires getting tangled up, poor electrical power trasmission, lack of frame stability, extra motor vibrations  and lack of battery capacity.

In the event we encounter issues with the 3D display, we plan on working on a 2D LED display instead.
